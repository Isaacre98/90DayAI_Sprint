# 90DayAI_Sprint
My 90 day challenge to level-up on AI.

Here, I will go deep into Python and Math to get a solid foundation and demystify AI. Then, I will get a solid understanding of Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and General Adversarial Networks (GANs).

This is the first step on my journey to become an AI specialist and build solutions that improve people's lives.
